{"name":"ICU","tagline":"Repository for the Island Climate Update scripts and IPython notebooks","body":"# Island Climate Update\r\n\r\nThis repository gathers scripts and notebooks used to generate various products\r\nrelated to the [Island Climate Update (ICU)](http://www.niwa.co.nz/climare/icu).\r\n\r\nThe Island Climate Update is a monthly Regional Climate Outlook Forum and outlook\r\nbulletin for the southwest Pacific.\r\n\r\ngo to:\r\n\r\n[https://speakerdeck.com/nicolasf/icu-175](https://speakerdeck.com/nicolasf/icu-175)\r\n\r\nTo view examples of these products incorportated in the presentation material uploaded\r\non [speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/) before the ICU teleconference.\r\n\r\n<hr size=5>\r\n\r\nThe scripts and [notebooks]() are written in the language [Python](). They make\r\nheavy use of the **Python scientific stack**: i.e. in particular the following libraries:\r\n\r\n+ Numpy\r\n+ Scipy\r\n+ Pandas\r\n+ Matplotlib\r\n+ Basemap\r\n\r\nTo get all these working on your platform (windows, linux, mac), I strongly recommend installing the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/), developed and made available for free by [Continuum Analytics](http://continuum.io/).  \r\n\r\nThe repo is organised in different sections:\r\n\r\n**1. [mailing]()**\r\n\r\n  generates the monthly mail sent to the ICU mailing list, with time of the teleconference\r\n  translated in the different time-zones in the region.\r\n\r\n  usage example:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  $ ./make_mail_ICU.py 175 2015 04 02 12 30\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n**2. [maps]()**\r\n\r\n  + TRMM Rainfall [(Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission)](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/trmm-tropical-rainfall-measuring-mission)\r\n\r\n    there are two versions:\r\n\r\n    + one makes use of the images directly available from the [Nasa TRMM website](http://trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov), updated daily for the last 30 days averages and anomalies: the script downloads the image, crops it and\r\n    overlay the image on a high resolution basemap of the southwest Pacific.\r\n\r\n      + see [plot_sp_30days_im_averages.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/nicolasfauchereau/ICU/blob/master/maps/TRMM/plot_sp_30days_im_averages.ipynb) for the last **30 days averages** map\r\n      + see [plot_sp_30days_im_anoms.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/nicolasfauchereau/ICU/blob/master/maps/TRMM/plot_sp_30days_im_anoms.ipynb) for the last **30 days anomalies** map\r\n\r\n\r\n    + The other is based on the actual data available from [](), the whole process is\r\n    constructed around a few scripts and notebooks:\r\n\r\n      + [get_daily_TRMM.py]() downloads the TRMM data daily in binary and converts the files\r\n      to NetCDF\r\n      + []()\r\n\r\n  + Sea Surface Temperature anomalies from the OI-SST dataset\r\n\r\n\r\n**3. ENSO indices**\r\n\r\n  + this [notebook]() downloads the Southern Oscillation Index and NINO indices data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology\r\n\r\n  + [NIWA SOI](): calculates the *NIWA* SOI according to the Troup method using the Tahiti and Darwin MSLP data made available at the [LongPaddock website]()\r\n\r\n**4. TRMM Regional Rainfall Estimates**\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
